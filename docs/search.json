Since the rate for hotels has a wide range on the Big Island, we decided not to reserve a room block so our guests could feel free to choose where to stay. There are a variety of lodging options close to the venue. Listed below are just a few options we found on Google, and our price information below is as of October 2023, before taxes and fees."
